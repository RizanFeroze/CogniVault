Remember, though, this doesn't define your worth or your future. There are always options and support available to help you get back on track. Have you had a chance to talk to a teacher, counselor, or someone you trust about how you're feeling? They might be able to offer some guidance or resources that could make a difference. You're not alone in this, and it's okay to ask for help."
